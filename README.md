# ElvUI-Updater

<h3>A simple, quality of life program to keep ElvUI up to date.</h3>
<p><a href="https://tukui.org/elvui" target="_blank" text-decoration="none">ElvUI</a>, one of the most popular UI addons for WoW, is rather unconventional to install. <br/>
  
  It isn't on any addon managers (e.g. Curseforge, WowUp) so whenever you need to update, <br/>you have to go to the ElvUI website and install it manually.
  
  This program aims to simplify that, bringing a one-click approach to keeping ElvUI updated simply and quickly.</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>Installation is simple, download the latest release and place the executable inside a folder and run it.</p>
<br/>
<p>Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build it yourself. This will require the .NET 6 SDK to be installed on your device.</p>
<p>When it first runs (or if you deleted the settings file), it will ask you to enter the path to your WoW addons folder.<br/><br/>
<p>You now just open the program and if your version is outdated, it will automatically update it.</p>
