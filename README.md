# ElvUI-Updater

<h4>A simple, quality of life program to keep ElvUI up to date.</h4>
<p><a href="https://tukui.org/elvui" text-decoration="none">ElvUI</a>, one of the most popular UI addons for WoW, is rather unconventional to install. <br/>
  
  It isn't on any addon managers (e.g. Curseforge, WowUp) so whenever you need to update you'll have to go to the ElvUI website <br/>and install it manually.
  
  This program aims to simplify that, bringing a one-click approach to keeping ElvUI updated in a simple and less annoying manner.</p>
