# ElvUI-Updater

<h3>A simple, quality of life program to keep ElvUI up to date.</h3>
<p><a href="https://tukui.org/elvui" target="_blank" text-decoration="none">ElvUI</a>, one of the most popular UI addons for WoW, is rather unconventional to install. <br/>
  
  It isn't on any addon managers (e.g. Curseforge, WowUp) so whenever you need to update, <br/>you have to go to the ElvUI website and install it manually.
  
  This program aims to simplify that, bringing a one-click approach to keeping ElvUI updated simply and quickly.</p>
<h1>Install</h3>
<h3>IMPORTANT: This program requires the .NET 6 Runtime which can be downloaded <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-6.0.29-windows-x64-installer">here</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Download the latest release from <a href="https://github.com/ArjanDeo/ElvUI-Updater/releases">here</a> and extract the executable to a suitable location.
  </li>
  <li>
    When it first runs (or if you deleted the settings file), it will ask you to enter the path to your WoW addons folder.
  </li>
  <li>
    You now just run the program and if your version is outdated, it will automatically update it.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can clone the repository and build it yourself.</p>
