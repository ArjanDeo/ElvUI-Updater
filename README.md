# ElvUI-Updater

<h3>A simple, quality of life program to keep ElvUI up to date.</h3>
<p><a href="https://tukui.org/elvui" target="_blank" text-decoration="none">ElvUI</a>, one of the most popular UI addons for WoW, is rather unconventional to install. <br/>
  
  It isn't on any addon managers (e.g. Curseforge, WowUp) so whenever you need to update you'll have to go to the ElvUI website <br/>and install it manually.
  
  This program aims to simplify that, bringing a one-click approach to keeping ElvUI updated in a simple and less annoying manner.</p>
<h3>Install</h3>
<p>Install is simple, download the latest release and place the executable inside a folder and run it.</p>
<p>On it's first run, it will ask you for the path to your addons folder, this is so it can locate where to install ElvUI.<br/><br/>
Once you input this it will be saved into a settings file <br/>
(note: if you delete this file, the program will act as if it's on it's first run and generate it again.) and all setup is done.<br/><br/>
You now just open the program and it will automatically update ElvUI. If ElvUI is already on the latest version it'll let you know as well.</p>
